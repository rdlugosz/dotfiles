# Update in 2022, found that I don't set too many of these any more.
# Listed below are the ones I've set on my latest mac.

# Disable press-and-hold for keys in favor of key repeat
defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

# Disabled in favor of using the options in the Keyboard prefs pane. For some reason
# when these are set the key repeat appears to "choke" - almost as if it's coming into
# the buffer faster than the application can output the keys (that's almost certainly not
# the case, but it looks that way).
# Set a blazingly fast keyboard repeat rate, and make it happen more quickly.
# defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 20
# defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
